# Face-Recognition-OpenCV-
Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces. It is analogous to image detection in which the image of a person is matched bit by bit.
Face Detection is the first and essential step for face recognition, and it is used to detect faces in the images. It is a part of object detection and can use in many areas such as security, bio-metrics, law enforcement, entertainment, personal safety, etc.
Face Recognition is a computer application that is capable of detecting, tracking, identifying or verifying human faces from an image or video captured using a digital camera. ... These issues are variations in human facial appearance such as; varying lighting condition, noise in face images, scale, pose etc.
This project consists of libraries open-cv , pandas,numpy . The algorithm used to perform this project is KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours)
